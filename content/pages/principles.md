`Version: 1.0.0`

## We prioritize trust and transparency

by openly communicating our methods and intentions behind all data collection and feedback processes.

## We value developer input and collaboration

in shaping the tools, processes, and environment that directly affect their work and well-being.

## We pledge to using metrics as a mirror, not a judge

to reflect on our collective practices and identify opportunities for improvement rather than individual performance.

## We recognize the importance of balance

by acknowledging that metrics provide a limited perspective and must be complemented with personal insights and context.

## We safeguard privacy and confidentiality

with the utmost care, ensuring that feedback and data cannot and will not be used to single out any individual.

## We embrace a culture of continuous improvement

where feedback leads to action, and actions are regularly reviewed and refined.

## We advocate for minimal tool sprawl

and strive to provide a seamless development experience, helping developers focus on their craft rather than on unnecessary complexity.

## We strive for a balanced ecosystem

where commonalities across teams are nurtured to foster collaboration and efficiency, while also supporting the diverse needs and workflows of our developers, promoting flexibility and customization.

## We acknowledge and respect Goodhartâ€™s Law

understanding that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure, and thus we seek a balanced approach to setting and evaluating our performance indicators.
