If we want to measure and enhance developer satisfaction and productivity, we must acknowledge that this requires a fundamental element: **Trust**.

Trust is the cornerstone of our efforts, influencing not only how we gather and interpret data but also how we interact with and support each other.

In an environment where metrics and feedback are integral, establishing and maintaining trust is paramount.

We understand that metrics, while invaluable for measuring progress and identifying areas for improvement, can often be misinterpreted or misused, potentially eroding the very trust we seek to build.

Therefore, our commitment to these principles is not just a matter of methodology, but a reflection of our dedication to fostering a culture of openness, respect, and mutual support.

By prioritizing trust and transparency, valuing collaboration, and being mindful of the impact of our measurement practices, we aim to create a space where developers feel genuinely supported and understood.

This is not just about optimizing processes, but about nurturing a work environment where everyone can thrive, innovate, and contribute to the best of their abilities.

## Principles

**We prioritize trust and transparency** by openly communicating our methods and intentions behind all data collection and feedback processes.

**We value developer input and collaboration** in shaping the tools, processes, and environment that directly affect their work and well-being.

**We pledge to using metrics as a mirror, not a judge** to reflect on our collective practices and identify opportunities for improvement rather than individual performance.

**We recognize the importance of balance** by acknowledging that metrics provide a limited perspective and must be complemented with personal insights and context.

**We safeguard privacy and confidentiality** with the utmost care, ensuring that feedback and data cannot and will not be used to single out any individual.

**We embrace a culture of continuous improvement** where feedback leads to action, and actions are regularly reviewed and refined.

**We advocate for minimal tool sprawl** and strive to provide a seamless development experience, helping developers focus on their craft rather than on unnecessary complexity.

**We strive for a balanced ecosystem** where commonalities across teams are nurtured to foster collaboration and efficiency, while also supporting the diverse needs and workflows of our developers, promoting flexibility and customization.

**We acknowledge and respect Goodhartâ€™s Law** understanding that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure, and thus we seek a balanced approach to setting and evaluating our performance indicators.
