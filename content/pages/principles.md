_We choose to follow these principles, to be transparent about our practices, and to hold ourselves accountable to these standards._

## > We prioritize trust and transparency

By openly communicating our methods and intentions behind all data collection and feedback processes.

## > We value developer input and collaboration

In shaping the tools, processes, and environment that directly affect their work and well-being.

## > We pledge to using metrics as a mirror, not a judge

To reflect on our collective practices and identify opportunities for improvement rather than individual performance.

## > We recognize the importance of balance

By acknowledging that metrics provide a limited perspective and must be complemented with personal insights and context.

## > We safeguard privacy and confidentiality

With the utmost care, ensuring that feedback and data cannot and will not be used to single out any individual.

## > We embrace a culture of continuous improvement

Where feedback leads to action, and actions are regularly reviewed and refined.

## > We advocate for minimal tool sprawl

And strive to provide a seamless development experience, helping developers focus on their craft rather than on unnecessary complexity.

## > We strive for a balanced ecosystem

Where commonalities across teams are nurtured to foster collaboration and efficiency, while also supporting the diverse needs and workflows of our developers, promoting flexibility and customization.

## > We acknowledge and respect Goodhartâ€™s Law

Understanding that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure, and thus we seek a balanced approach to setting and evaluating our performance indicators.
