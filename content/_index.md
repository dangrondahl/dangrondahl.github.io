`Version: 0.1.0`

_In our quest to measure and improve developer experience, we've come to understand that the true value lies not in the metrics themselves, but the questions they raise and the conversations they spark._

_We recognize that metrics, when distrusted, are always susceptible to manipulation, and when misunderstood, they are prone to misuse._

_We've realized that to make this work, it all boils down to two key things: **Trust** and **Transparency**._

## We value

**Insight Over Precision** Emphasizing the significance of trends and patterns for guidance rather than solely depending on absolute metrics.

**Understanding Over Evaluation** Prioritizing constructive feedback and learning opportunities over judgment or appraisal.

**Inquiry Over Conclusion** Focusing on using metrics to spark questions and exploration rather than simply providing definitive answers.

**Adaptability Over Rigidity** Valuing flexibility and responsiveness to new insights and changes in the development landscape over strict adherence to predefined metrics.

**Transparency Over Obscurity** Ensuring clear, open communication about data collection, analysis, and use to build trust and understanding.
