# The DevEx Manifesto

Welcome to the DevEx Manifesto! ðŸ‘‹

This repository holds the content of The DevEx Manifesto (https://devexmanifesto.org), a set of values and principles that I believe are essential to our collective success and the integrity of our work when it comes to measuring and improving developer productivity and experience.
