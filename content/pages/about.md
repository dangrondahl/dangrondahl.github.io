## Why a DevEx Manifesto?

### A bit of history...

The idea for the DevEx Manifesto came from being a consultant on a small enabler team.
Our teams mission? To improve developer experience across the teams within their organization.

Naturally we needed to both know and show the impact of our efforts.
So early on we figured that measuring our own success in terms of the "products" we offered, somehow also meant that we needed to measure the teams using them.

However, this wasn't the first time they tried to measure developer productivity though.
Like many other companies, they had previously ventured into deploying [DORA](https://dora.dev/) metrics. The outcome? A lot of distrust and skepticism.

This hardly came as a surprise. My experiences have shown that top-down implementations of metrics like DORA often stumble for several reasons: Metrics are sometimes perceived more as definitive answers rather than as curious prompts for further inquiry. Additionally, the comparison of teams and individuals frequently overlooks the substantial differences in their respective contexts and environments.

So, even though the intentions were good, how could we reintroduce measures that may have lead to distrust earlier on? And how could we do so in a way that would not only be accepted, but embraced by the teams?

The answer was to start with a set of principles that would guide our efforts and ensure that we would not only measure the right things, but also do so in the right way.

### The DevEx Manifesto

The DevEx Manifesto is a set of principles that we believe are essential to our collective success and the integrity of our work. We hold ourselves accountable to these standards, as they are the cornerstone of our progress and the measure of our achievements.

Even more importantly, the DevEx Manifesto is a promise to developers that we will always strive to uphold these principles. Both from the team(s) implementing the measures, but all the way to leaders that is just as responsible for not misusing the data and thereby eroding the trust of the teams.

Lorem _markdownum notam si_ lintea meque certa [en meumque

[Paviunt castris](#nemorisque-urimur-violentus) cur errat ventis causa! Silvas

**Cineres Nile ipsa** origine discurrunt adest Unde, et quem clausus, imo,
virens quoque tales, potuit. Ingentes insilit corpore nutricis praebebat roganti
licuit. Denique a vestros adulantum in bella lina parte et arte generi di igitur
quis, digitis pedes. Cum resonant tamen, namque in anxia. Non nostri trahens
ancora.

## Ducem oculos pallor tale quoque

Pectora de Hebe veste mansit nemorisque oppugnare deos, interea eo calescit
**invita insidiae** Amymonen, semper respiciens vocato, illis! Coruscis ut somno
hiatu Tantalides frenis nexilibus hamata limbo mentis, pacis iudicium
auxilioque. Genus dolori, me ira hae inpediunt tellus, nascendi Boreas!
Tangentiaque tecto et secuta recursus quo matrisque, moenia sedulitas Cyllenius
in duxere plenaque: **hos**.

2. Verus ego ovantem mihi

4. Dabis natis hoc genu in quidem dumque

Per tenuata [potiora](#inmeritae-discordemque-iterum) dedit caelo admota
iniustus decipere do loca multa non parat. Ingratos his ut inde credite sensit
sorte. Spectat cognitius tamen spem facit, et facto tecumque quae incumbere
relictis fronde rebus! Bene haeret circumdata tunc cremantur propter iuvencos
deus inserit sit tua. Pompa non precor procumbit inania lacrimas sacra credetis:
Oceano, femina?

Bacchantum neque. Humum ut violasse quam inmotos! Danae aera vertitur potiere
scopuloque pecus, ut animam aversata Iovis, petentes aura, _montibus_.
