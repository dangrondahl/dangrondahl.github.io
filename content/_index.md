### In our effort to assess and improve developer productivity and experience, </br>we've come to understand

That the use of metrics and performance indicators are tools, never the final goal.

That metrics may be useful for gauging progress towards goals we want to achieve, but only if they help us make better decisions from the questions they raise.

That metrics, when distrusted, are always susceptible to manipulation, and when misunderstood, they are prone to misuse.

That, in the interaction between people and technology, the success of using metrics comes down to two key elements: **Trust** and **Transparency**.

## We value

**Insight Over Precision** - Emphasizing the significance of trends and patterns for guidance rather than solely depending on absolute metrics.

**Understanding Over Evaluation** - Prioritizing constructive feedback and learning opportunities over judgment or appraisal.

**Inquiry Over Conclusion** - Focusing on using metrics to spark questions and exploration rather than simply providing definitive answers.

**Adaptability Over Rigidity** - Valuing flexibility and responsiveness to new insights and changes in the development landscape over strict adherence to predefined metrics.

**Transparency Over Obscurity** - Ensuring clear, open communication about data collection, analysis, and use to build trust and understanding.
