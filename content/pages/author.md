## Hi there, I'm Dan :wave:

I work as a DevOps consultant, helping teams and organizations build internal developer platforms and improve their developer experience, for the benefit of both the teams and the business. :rocket:

I believe that happy developers are productive developers and vice versa. I also believe that the best way to improve developer experience is to look at the capabilities of the organization as a whole, and involve the developers themselves in the process.

This has been my guiding principle in my work with developer experience, and it's also the reason why I created the DevEx Manifesto. :innocent:

## Inspiration 

I am deeply influenced by thought leaders I admire, such as Matthew Skelton, Manuel Pais, Dr. Nicole Forsgren, John Cutler, Abi Noda, Gergely Orosz, and Johan Abildskov, who has often mentored me in our shared passion for DevOps and software development. The list is long... I'm grateful to everyone who has inspired me in this journey. üôè
