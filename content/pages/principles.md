_As leaders or peers e.g. within enabling teams, we commit to these principles for transparency and accountability.</br>
We follow these principles, to make fair and empathetic decisions.</br>
Without trust from our developers, our best intentions and efforts will be in vain._

## > We prioritize trust and transparency

By openly communicating our methods and intentions behind all data collection and feedback processes.

## > We value developer input and collaboration 

In shaping the tools, processes, and environment that directly affect their work and well-being.

## > We pledge to using metrics as a mirror, not a judge

To reflect on our collective practices and identify opportunities for improvement rather than individual 
performance.

## > We emphasize team-centric productivity metrics

While recognizing each individual's contributions, we prioritize the team as the fundamental unit of delivery, 
ensuring that our measures reflect and support this perspective.

## > We embrace a culture of continuous improvement

We regularly review our metrics and feedback practices, and make adjustments based on our learnings.

## > We advocate for minimal tool sprawl

We strive to provide a seamless development experience, helping developers focus on their craft rather than on
unnecessary complexity.

## > We strive for a balanced ecosystem

We foster shared practices across teams to boost consistency, collaboration and efficiency, while avoiding a 
one-size-fits-all approach.

## > We dismiss the 'one-metric' approach

Recognizing it easily becomes a vanity metric. Instead we gauge productivity using multiple metrics and methods 
that respects the complexity of software development.

## > We acknowledge and respect Goodhartâ€™s Law

We understand that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. Metrics are never goals, at 
best, they are proxies to guide us on the right track.
