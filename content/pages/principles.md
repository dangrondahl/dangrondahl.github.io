In our effort to assess and improve developer productivity and experience, we are guided by the following principles, to make fair and empathetic decisions.</br>
As leaders or peers e.g. within enabling teams, we commit to these principles for transparency and accountability. Without trust from our developers, our best intentions and efforts will be in vain.

# Principles
## > We prioritize trust and transparency

We openly communicate our methods and intentions behind all data collection and feedback processes to build trust.
This means clearly explaining the purpose and use of any data we gather from developers, ensuring transparency in how this information influences decisions. We provide regular, straightforward updates about changes in tools or processes and actively seek and respond to feedback, fostering a culture where every team member is informed and their voice is valued.

> **Example** </br>
> We use a tool to collect data on how developers use our internal platform. This data is used to identify areas for improvement and to measure the impact of our efforts. We share this data with our developers and explain how it is used to improve the platform and developer experience.

## > We regard developer input as fundamental in collaboration

In shaping tools, processes, and the work environment, we consider developer input essential, as it directly influences the perceived ease of software delivery. With our collaborative approach we aim to refine these aspects, enhancing not just efficiency but also making software development more intuitive and satisfying for developers.

> **Example** </br>
> We regularly ask developers for feedback on our internal platform, and use this input to improve the platform and developer experience.

## > We pledge to using metrics as a mirror, not a judge

To reflect on our collective practices and identify opportunities for improvement, we use metrics as insightful guides. This enables us to evolve our workflows and enhance overall productivity, fostering a culture of continuous development and learning at the team and organizational level.

> **Example** </br>
> We use metrics to identify areas for improvement and to measure the impact of our efforts. We're not blaming individuals or teams for low or falling metrics, instead we use them as a starting point for inquiry and exploration, together with the teams.

## > We emphasize team-centric productivity metrics

We balance individual and team productivity, emphasizing a team-first approach in our feedback and data practices. While recognizing each individual's contributions, we prioritize the team as the fundamental unit of delivery, ensuring that our measures reflect and support this perspective.

> **Example** </br>
> We use team-centric metrics to measure the impact of our efforts, for example the perceived Ease of Delivery across teams using our internal platform.

## > We embrace a culture of continuous improvement

Where feedback leads to action, and actions are regularly reviewed and refined.

> **Example** </br>
> We regularly review our metrics and feedback practices, and make adjustments based on our learnings. We communicate our results, learnings and areas of focus every quarter.

## > We advocate for minimal tool sprawl

We strive to provide a seamless development experience, helping developers focus on their craft rather than on unnecessary complexity. Evaluating cognitive load is among our key consideration in our tooling decisions.

> **Example** </br>
> We routinely evaluate our tools and processes to keep them effective. When migrating to a new tool, we ensure that it is a clear improvement over the previous one. We believe a migration isn't complete with the introduction of a new tool, only when the old one is fully retired.

## > We strive for a balanced ecosystem

We nurture commonalities across teams to enhance collaboration and efficiency, while also accommodating the unique needs and workflows of our developers. This balance supports both flexibility and customization.

> **Example** </br>
> We provide a set of common tools and processes that are used across teams. We are curious if teams are using other tools and processes, and we seek to understand why. Maybe our offerings are lacking, or maybe the team has a unique need that we can help with.

## > We dismiss the 'one-metric' approach

We appreciate that no single metric can fully capture the multi-dimensional nature of development work. By combining diverse metrics with contextual understanding, we aim to provide a holistic view that respects the complexity of software development.
We value developers' perception of their own productivity and experience, and we use qualitative feedback to complement quantitative metrics.

> **Example** </br>
> We use a set of metrics to measure the impact of our efforts, for example the perceived Ease of Delivery, the number of deployments, and the number of support requests. We regularly ask developers for their opinion on our efforts, and we use this input to improve the platform and developer experience.

## > We acknowledge and respect Goodhartâ€™s Law

Understanding that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure, and thus we seek a balanced approach to setting and evaluating our performance indicators.

> **Example** </br>
> Corollary to the previous principle, we avoid using any single metric as the sole indicator of success. Metrics are not goals in themselves. Metrics are, at best, proxies to guide us on the right track.
