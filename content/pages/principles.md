_We choose to follow these principles, to be transparent about our practices, and to hold ourselves accountable to these standards._

## > We prioritize trust and transparency

By openly communicating our methods and intentions behind all data collection and feedback processes.

## > We regard developer input as fundamental in collaboration

In shaping tools, processes, and the work environment, we consider developer input essential, as it directly influences the perceived ease of software delivery. Our collaborative approach aims to refine these aspects, enhancing not just efficiency but also making software development more intuitive and satisfying for our developers.

## > We pledge to using metrics as a mirror, not a judge

To reflect on our collective practices and identify opportunities for improvement rather than individual performance.

## > We recognize the importance of balance

By acknowledging that metrics provide a limited perspective and must be complemented with personal insights and context.

## > We safeguard privacy and confidentiality

With the utmost care, ensuring that feedback and data cannot and will not be used to single out any individual.

## > We embrace a culture of continuous improvement

Where feedback leads to action, and actions are regularly reviewed and refined.

## > We advocate for minimal tool sprawl

And strive to provide a seamless development experience, helping developers focus on their craft rather than on unnecessary complexity.

## > We strive for a balanced ecosystem

Where commonalities across teams are nurtured to foster collaboration and efficiency, while also supporting the diverse needs and workflows of our developers, promoting flexibility and customization.

## > We acknowledge and respect Goodhartâ€™s Law

Understanding that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure, and thus we seek a balanced approach to setting and evaluating our performance indicators.
