## Why a DevEx Manifesto?

You might be wondering why yet another manifesto? Aren't there enough of those already? Well, yes and no.

### A bit of history...

The inspiration for the DevEx Manifesto came from my discussions with various individuals in multiple IT organizations, encompassing a range of roles such as leaders, managers, developers, and others who act as catalysts for change, focusing on enhancing developer productivity and the overall developer experience.

Often, they express a shared goal which is to improve developer productivity as a way of achieving broader business and organizational objectives. These goals might include reducing lead times or lowering software operational costs, among others.

Such initiatives may come from leaders seeking to use metrics to track and evaluate the impact of e.g. a DevOps transformation. Alternatively, they might originate from enabling teams dedicated to improve the developer experience across teams, but don't know where to start.

In either case, the question is often the same: How do we measure developer productivity?
A common approach I've often witnessed is to pick a framework like DORA, and start with the four [DORA metrics](https://dora.dev/) as a good starting point. But is this really the best way to start?

### The problem with starting with metrics

I've seen many organizations try to measure developer productivity, and I've seen many of them fail. Why? Because they start out with metrics, and not with asking themselves and their developers how they define developer productivity.
What does productivity mean to them? What does it mean to their teams? What does it mean to their organization?

When we don't start with asking these questions, we often end up with something that resembles data fishing. We start with the data, and then we try to find a story to fit the data. But this is a flawed approach, because it doesn't take into account the context and environment of the teams and individuals.

When metrics are used nakedly to compare teams and individuals, it often leads to a culture of competition, where teams and individuals are pitted against each other. This can lead to a culture of distrust and lead to a behavior of
gaming the metrics, where teams and individuals are trying to optimize for the metrics, rather than improving daily work for themselves and their teams.

So whether picking a quantitative or qualitative approach, it's important to start with sound principles and values. It's not any different from the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/): Start with principles and values, and then find the practices that fit your organizations capabilities and context.

That's how I came up with the idea of the DevEx Manifesto.

### So what is it?

The DevEx Manifesto is a set of [values]({{< ref "/" >}}) and [principles]({{< ref "/principles" >}} "principles") that we believe are essential to our collective success and the integrity of our work. We hold ourselves accountable to these standards, as they are the cornerstone of our progress and the measure of our achievements.

Even more importantly, the DevEx Manifesto is a promise to developers that we will always strive to uphold these. Both from the team(s) implementing the measures, but all the way to leaders that is just as responsible for not misusing the data and thereby eroding the trust of the teams.

Therefore, should you choose to adopt the DevEx Manifesto, make sure to communicate it to the teams, and make sure to hold yourself accountable to it. Have leaders sign off
on it, so everyone knows that they are also committed to upholding it.

## Please contribute :pray:

Now, I unfortunately didn't have the luxury to meet up with thought leaders in the Wasatch mountains of Utah, like the authors of the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/history.html) did. But in the days of GitHub, we don't need to.

The DevEx Manifesto is a living set of values and principles. It's not a static document, and hopefully it will evolve over time. This is why it's versioned.

My naive hope is that the DevEx Manifesto eventually will become a community-driven document. It is only as good as the people who contribute to it, and the people who use it.

As we learn more about developer experience, I will update the DevEx Manifesto accordingly. Therefore, I encourage you to contribute to the DevEx Manifesto by either opening an issue or submitting a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/dangrondahl/dangrondahl.github.io)
