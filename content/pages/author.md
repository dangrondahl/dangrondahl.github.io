### Hi there, I'm Dan :wave:

I work as a DevOps consultant, helping teams and organizations build internal developer platforms and improve their developer experience, for the benefit of both the teams and the business. :rocket:

I believe that happy developers are productive developers and vice versa. I also believe that the best way to improve developer experience is to look at the capabilities of the organization as a whole, and involve the developers themselves in the process.

This has been my guiding principle in my work with developer experience, and it's also the reason why I created the DevEx Manifesto. :innocent:

My thoughts and mental models have been shaped by people within the industry I truly admire for their contributions. People like Matthew Skelton and Manual Pais, Nicole Forsgren, Abi Noda, John Cutler, and many more. The list goes on, and I'm grateful for all the people who have inspired me. :pray:

If you want to know more about me, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dangrondahl/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dangrondahl).
