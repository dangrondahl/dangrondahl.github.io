_We choose to follow these principles, to be transparent about our practices, and to hold ourselves accountable to these standards._

## > We prioritize trust and transparency

We openly communicating our methods and intentions behind all data collection and feedback processes. This builds trust.

## > We regard developer input as fundamental in collaboration

In shaping tools, processes, and the work environment, we consider developer input essential, as it directly influences the perceived ease of software delivery. Our collaborative approach aims to refine these aspects, enhancing not just efficiency but also making software development more intuitive and satisfying for our developers.

## > We pledge to using metrics as a mirror, not a judge

To reflect on our collective practices and identify opportunities for improvement, we use metrics as insightful guides. This enables us to evolve our workflows and enhance overall productivity, fostering a culture of continuous development and learning at the team and organizational level.

## > We emphasize team-centric productivity metrics

We balance individual and team productivity, emphasizing a team-first approach in our feedback and data practices. While recognizing each individual's contributions, we prioritize the team as the fundamental unit of delivery, ensuring that our measures reflect and support this perspective.

## > We embrace a culture of continuous improvement

Where feedback leads to action, and actions are regularly reviewed and refined.

## > We advocate for minimal tool sprawl

We strive to provide a seamless development experience, helping developers focus on their craft rather than on unnecessary complexity.

## > We strive for a balanced ecosystem

Where commonalities across teams are nurtured to foster collaboration and efficiency, while also supporting the diverse needs and workflows of our developers, promoting flexibility and customization.

## > We dismiss the 'one-metric' approach

We appreciate that no single metric can fully capture the multifaceted nature of development work. By combining diverse metrics with contextual understanding, we aim to provide a comprehensive view that respects the complexity of software development. This approach ensures a more accurate and holistic assessment of productivity, avoiding overreliance on any single measure.

## > We acknowledge and respect Goodhartâ€™s Law

Understanding that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure, and thus we seek a balanced approach to setting and evaluating our performance indicators.
